## About
My personal project to process, analyze housing sales data (the trend of average housing price, housing price by location on map, relationship between view, condition, price, etc.) using Python (pandas, numpy), SQL and visualize data using Tableau.

## Tableau dashboard
* Link to dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sally.dinh/viz/DailyAverageHouseSalesPrice/KCHouseSalesDashboard

* Note: Charts, graphs, map will change based on the selected date / month in calendar on the top left of the dashboard.

## Analysis and Insights
* The daily average housing price typically fluctuated between $300K to $800K, but skyrocketed to more than $2M in mid-October 2014, and reached $1.3M by the end of May 2015.
* The top 3 cities with the highest daily average housing price are Medina, WA ($2,160,607), Bellevue, WA ($1,355,927) and Mercer Island, WA ($1,194,230).
* Overall, the average price / sqft is nearly the same for houses with and without waterfront when these houses have good or excellent views. For houses with an average view, the average price/sqft without a waterfront is slightly higher than with a waterfront. However, houses with no view or fair view are more expensive without a waterfront.
* The distribution of the house price is skewed right.
* Houses typically have 3 to 4 bedrooms.
* Houses with excellent views - average or better condition tend to have high prices. 
+ Overall, houses with excellent views and average condition have the highest average price ($1,515,327), followed by excellent view - very good condition ($1,506,967) and excellent view - good condition ($1,374,062). 
+ Houses with average to fair views - average or good condition have medium average prices from approximately $720K to $851K.
+ Houses with fair view and poor-worn out condition has the lowest average price of $295K
